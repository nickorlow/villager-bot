# Villager Bot
Bot I wrote around 12/2020 for me and a few friends. 

Villager Bot makes playing minecraft multiplayer easier by requiring that a certain number of people must be online & playing. This stops people with more free time from 'grinding' and becoming far better than everyone else, ultimately ruining the server. 

The bot in it's current state is build for our specific implementation. If anyone wants to use it, you'll have to create a discord bot [here] (https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications). After that, change all of the ids (guild, channel, role) to match your server and set the bot to run on your server. Depending on the minecraft server/version you're using, you'll also want to change the path to that.

In the future if I come back to this, I'll make everything work with env vars & proper discord guild/channel handling to make this all easier. It is possible to have just one bot hosted by me to get this to work and use a plugin on the server to control if people can join. Using this plugin approach would also allow for whitelisting of users who can access the server at any time.
